  "<div class='lead' markdown='1'>The Kolekto API is organized around the REST principles. Each endpoint accepts correctly encoded JSON or form parameters, along with a 
  valid HTTP method and will return JSON-encoded responses, along with predictable HTTP status codes.</div>

  <p>This documentation contains reference data for all endpoints that are currently supported by the API. It is intended for internal use only, but in the long term may be 
  opened up if there is sufficient interest in developing external or third-party applications.</p>

  <p>If you spot any errors, please contact Ben Major.</p>"
